# IECEPCLxSG-Python
Repository for data and notebooks used in the recently concluded IECEPCLxSG webinar: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning



NOTE:

1. When loading the files using pandas functions (e.g., .read_csv(), .read_json(), etc.) make sure to change the file path to data/<desired file>.
2. Example for loading a data: df = pd.read_json('data/classification.json')

  
How to use?
  1. Download and install Anaconda Navigator (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
  2. Download and install Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  3. Verify that the installation was successful: Open cmd and type git --version
  4. Open JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook
  5. From the launcher, open a new terminal and navigate to your desired path. This is where you will clone this repository (e.g., C:\Users\Desktop).
  6. On the terminal (or CMD), type git clone https://github.com/jayr1125/IECEPCLxSG-Python
  7. Now, you can run the notebooks. Enjoy!
